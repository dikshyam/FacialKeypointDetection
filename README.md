## Overview

Facial Keypoints Detection is the most challenging task in the field of computer vision and machine learning. Facial features vary from one individual to another and even for the same person, there is a lot of discrepancy at different views and angles. The objective of this task is to predict keypoint positions on face images which can be used as a building block in several applications, such as: 

  - tracking faces in images and video 
  - analysing facial expressions 
  - detecting dysmorphic facial signs for medical diagnosis 
  - biometrics / face recognition This is a multi-domain problem. 
  
It has a wide variety of applications. There are two main challenges for facial keypoints detection, one is that facial features have great variance between different people and different external factors, the other is that we have to reduce time complexity to achieve real-time keypoints detection. Link to this Kaggle Competition can be found here. We chose this topic because this is pretty new and interesting to the both of us. This is our first project in Computer Vision where we’re employing Neural Networks.
Dataset to be used is that of the Facial Keypoint Recognition (Kaggle Competition 2019) at this Link. The dataset we use is from Kaggle’s facial keypoints detection competition.
